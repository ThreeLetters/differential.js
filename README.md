# differential.js
JS HTML Animations made easy.

```js
D(element,{
    width: '100px',
    height: '10px'
});
```
## Features

* Very efficient - Faster than other libraries such as Velocity and JQuery
* Standalone - No plugins needed
* Flexible and simple - A tree could use the API
* Animations for anything! Colors, functions (eg, `calculate(100% - 10px)`), hooks, unit conversions, and more
